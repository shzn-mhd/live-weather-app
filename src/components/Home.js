        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
        Cabbage farmers in the Badulla district of Uva Province are facing significant challenges due to erratic rainfall. The unpredictable weather, including long dry periods followed by heavy
        rainfall, is affecting crop yields and quality. Farmers struggle to plan their planting, irrigation, and harvesting schedules, leading to financial losses. The lack of reliable, real-time weather information makes it difficult for farmers to make informed decisions. There is a clear need for a 
        web-based platform that provides accurate weather forecasts and practical advice to help farmers 
        in Badulla manage their crops more effectively and improve productivity despite changing weather patterns
